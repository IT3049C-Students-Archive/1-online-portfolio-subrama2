      <p>
        Hello this is Annamalai a student from the university of Cincinnati. I am from India. I have one brother and one
        sister. My brother is a senior in high school in the year 2020-2021. My sister is in sixth grade. My mother is a
        housewife and my dad is an application manager in a insurance company. I am very friendly and communicative. I
        hope to get even better at talking and meeting new people.
        My favorite sport is soccer. I have played in AYSO since 4th grade. I hope to continue playing. I also am in
        National Honors Society in my high school. I loved it because I can do service projects with my friends. The
        first
        service project that I did was caroling at a oldage home. Also I have done community service for my high school
        like earthday and did recording for kids at a public library. I also am into shows from netflix like Legacies
        and
        Cobra Kai. Also i like to play my xbox 1 for entertainment. The games that I mostly play are FIFA games.
        I want to major in Information Technology. I hope to be a software developer someday. Since from High School i
        have been in 2 to 3 coding camps. I work at Walmart part time. This is my first real paid job and it is very
        exciting to work there. I have learned many different things by working there like being responsible and how to
        handle angry customers.
